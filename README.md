In this project, I used Power BI to analyze HR data and uncover key insights related to employees.
The primary objective of this analysis is to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions by identifying factors affecting overall workforce diversity. Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, this project provides a clear and actionable view of HR metrics, enabling better strategic planning for talent management and organizational growth.
