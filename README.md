# HRDataAnalysis_by_PowerBI
In this project, I used Power BI to analyze HR data and uncover key insights related to employees.
The primary objective of this analysis is to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions by identifying factors affecting overall workforce diversity. Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, this project provides a clear and actionable view of HR metrics, enabling better strategic planning for talent management and organizational growth.

The following questions will be answered :
How many people in each job?
Gender Break-down of staff
Age spread of the staff
Which jobs pay more?
Top earners in each job
Qualification vs. Salary
Staff growth trend over time
Employee filter by starting letter

Quick HR Dashboard
